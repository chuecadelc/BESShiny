This is my second Shiny App. In this app I used the British Election Survey of 2016 to showcase measures of central tendency, statistical tests such as chi-square and t-tests as well as measures of association. In terms of visualisations it has variable frequencies plots, histograms, and crosstabulations.

The aim of this app is to explain the different relationships between the variables of the British Election Survey. In particular it will look at the relationships between ordinal and nominal variables.


The data obtained from the British Election Survey University Consortium. This organism has been collecting UK electoral behaviour data for over fifty years. See here: https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/
